Hedge Trade Manager is an Expert Advisor (EA) tool developed by the Forex Robot Easy team. This EA is designed to optimize Forex trading by executing hedge trades based on certain conditions.

## Features

- Manual and automated execution of hedge trades.
- Configurable pip loss threshold to trigger a hedge trade.
- Configurable take profit for hedge trades.

## Installation

To use Hedge Trade Manager, simply copy the provided code into your MQL5 Editor and compile it. Make sure to enable the necessary execution options (manual and/or automated) and configure the desired pip loss threshold and take profit levels.

## How it Works

The Hedge Trade Manager EA works by continuously monitoring the loss incurred from the previous trade. If the loss exceeds the specified pip loss threshold, a hedge trade is triggered.

### Manual Execution

If manual execution is enabled, the EA will execute a hedge trade when the loss threshold is met. Manual execution allows the trader to have control over when the hedge trade is executed.

### Automated Execution

If automated execution is enabled, the EA will also execute a hedge trade when the loss threshold is met. Automated execution eliminates the need for manual intervention and allows the EA to automatically execute the trade.

Once a hedge trade is executed, the EA sets the take profit level for the trade. The hedge trade will be closed automatically when the take profit level is reached.
